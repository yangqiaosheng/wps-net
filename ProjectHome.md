_07.21.11_ - Initial import of the WPS.NET (check the SVN!) on googlecode. However, the project is already mature and fully functional! Let's try it!


## About ##

**WPS.NET** is an implementation of the [OGC WPS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps) standard on the .NET plateform developed by guys at [BRGM](http://www.brgm.fr) (the French geological survey).
**WPS.NET** can be easily deployed on a IIS web server to serve your own processing services. The processes stub must be developped in .NET (ie. C# or C++/CLI for instance).
